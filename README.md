In your project, you are required to trace students’ performance on several courses at the 
Belgium Campus University of Computing.  
• For instance, on one of the courses the students can take two mid-term exams during one 
semester.  
• At the end of the semester all scores, including those for mid-term, lecture attendance 
and weekly assessments, are summarized and anyone with the scores exceeding a pre
set limit can take final exam.  
• The students with enough scores on the final exam pass the course. 
• By interviewing end users, you will learn of their main needs and concerns.  
• At this phase, it should be found out which questions they want to be answered and why 
it is not possible before the warehouse is designed.  
• Defining end users’ needs gives the information about the future data warehouse 
content.  
• The goals of the warehouse should be clearly set, although they might change and be 
upgraded during design. 
• End users must be contacted at later stages of data warehousing and they must be active 
in designing the warehouse.  
• End users of your data warehouse may be the teaching staff and or any of the interested 
Belgium staff members.
